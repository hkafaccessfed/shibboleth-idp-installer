# Installation

You MUST have completed the [requirements checklist](requirements-checklist.html) before continuing installation. Environmental preperation is critical to a successful outcome.

## Actions undertaken during installation

The installation process will:

* Perform a `yum -y update` (system wide package upgrade). Please note that the installer uses `yum` for the installation of all system components (except Jetty and Shibboleth IdP).

* Install all required dependencies via `yum` (`git`, `ansible`, `mariadb`, `apache` etc). With the previous step in mind, bootstrap will always use the latest versions of these packages.

* Create self signed keys for Apache. These are for initial testing of the IdP and are replaced when further customising the Shibboleth IdP.

* Install Apache.

* Install Jetty with Shibboleth IdP. Jetty runs on port `8080` and creates the Shibboleth IdP web app context `/idp`. Apache configuration serves this on port `443` through a reverse proxy. Jetty also listens on port `8443` to support ECP.

* Install a MariaDB instance. A database is created (name: `idp_db`, user: `idp_admin`) with [these schemas](https://github.com/hkafaccessfed/shibboleth-idp-installer/tree/master/templates/db) populated.

* Install NTP for time syncronisation.

* Opens local firewall ports `80`, `443` and `8443`.

## Event logging
The installer provides a detailed set of information indicating the steps it has undertaken on your server. You MAY disregard this output if the process completes successfully.

For future review all installer output is logged to:

    /opt/shibboleth-idp-installer/activity.log

## Running the installer
The following commands MUST be executed as the **root** user. Start the process from `/root`.

1.  Run the command:

    ```
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hkafaccessfed/shibboleth-idp-installer/hk/branding/bootstrap.sh > bootstrap.sh && chmod u+x bootstrap.sh
    ```

2.  Edit the bootstrap file:

    ```
    vi bootstrap.sh
    ```
    - You MUST review, configure and uncomment each field listed in the "`MANDATORY SECTION`"
    - If you have LDAP details you SHOULD also configure the "`OPTIONAL SECTION`".

        You MAY further configure LDAP connection details, including TLS if required, after bootstrap has completed.

3.  Run the command:

    ```
    ./bootstrap.sh
    ```

    The bootstrap process will now configure your server to operate as a Shibboleth IdP.

## Errors during installation
If an error occurs, the logs prior to installer termination MUST be reviewed to understand the underpinning cause.

Generally the installer **SHOULD be executed once**.

After the initial execution you'll recieve an error if you try to run `bootstrap.sh` again.

You MUST NOT re-run `bootstrap.sh` if the installation process completed but you made a simple mistake. e.g.

* Mistyped config in the MANDATORY SECTION
* Mistyped config in the OPTIONAL SECTION

If you force `bootstrap.sh` to run again once initial installation has completed the action MAY be *destructive*.

In this scenario you should continue with federation registration as documented below and then make any configuration
changes necessary as documented within the customisation stage following completion of the installation stage as documented below.

### Reasons to re-run the installer
You MUST NOT re-run `bootstrap.sh`, unless:

* The script indicates you did not provide all required configuration options before your initial execution
* The underpinning Ansible based installation process fails during installation

If the latter scenario occurs you MUST correct the root cause of the error before attempting to continue.

### Allowing the installer to run again
If you've met all conditions run the installer again:

```
rm /root/.lock-idp-bootstrap && ./bootstrap.sh
```

The bootstrap process will now start over and attempt to configure your server to operate as a Shibboleth IdP.

## Registration with the federation

Once completed the bootstrap process will output information specific to your installation which you will use to register your Shibboleth IdP with the federation. Please follow the onscreen guide in order to complete the registration process.

After completing the registration process, you will receive an email from the federation indicating your Shibboleth IdP is pending approval by the AAF. The approval process can take **upto 24 hours**. For further assistance please contact [support@aaf.edu.au](mailto:support@aaf.edu.au)

## Installation finalisation steps

### 1. Configure LDAP connectivity

If you provided basic LDAP details to the bootstrap process you MAY skip this section.

If you:

* Wish to use TLS connections; or
* Have an advanced deployment scenario for your directory infrastructure:

Undertake the following steps:

1. **Locate local configuration files**

    You MUST make any changes you require below within:

    `/opt/shibboleth-idp-installer/repository/assets/<HOST_NAME>/idp/conf`

    and NOT

    `/opt/shibboleth-idp/conf`

    which is the default path documented in external resources. All specific config file names, e.g. `ldap.properties`, remain the same.

2. **Configure LDAP options**

    Please see the [Shibboleth IdP LDAP](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/IDP30/LDAPAuthnConfiguration) documentation for a description of all available LDAP options.

    Undertake configuration changes or certificate additions to the server as necessary.

3. **Apply Changes**

    After changing LDAP configuration you MUST run the command:

    ```
    /opt/shibboleth-idp-installer/repository/update_idp.sh
    ```

    This will merge the changes as required and reload the Shibboleth IdP to apply them.

### 2. Recieve Shibboleth IdP Approval

Following approval by the HKAF you'll **receive a second email**.

Please wait for at least 4 hours after receiving this email, so back end processes and data sync is definitely completed, before undertaking the instructions it contains to gain administrative rights over your Shibboleth IdP within HKAF management tools.

### 3. Add Backchannel certificates

The final installation step involves providing your backchannel certificates to the HKAF management tool, Federation Registry.

Access your Shibboleth IdP record within Federation Registry and navigate to *SAML -> Certificates*

1. Add the contents of `/opt/shibboleth/shibboleth-idp/current/credentials/idp-backchannel.crt` as a certificate for signing.
2. Add the contents of `/opt/shibboleth/shibboleth-idp/current/credentials/idp-encryption.crt` as an encryption certificate.

## Next Step

Once you've finalised installation please continue to the [customisation](customisation.html) stage where we'll test your installation and show you how to tune things as necessary for your environment.
